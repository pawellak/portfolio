  "label.about_me.description": "<h3>For over 3.5 years, I have been professionally creating mobile applications in Flutter, transforming business needs into intuitive and efficient solutions.</h3><p>My portfolio includes an application developed for a <strong>leading Polish energy company</strong>, which is currently used by over <strong>300,000 active users</strong> and holds a user rating of <strong>4.7</strong> on the Google Play and App Store.</p><p>The application I created for a global logistics company <strong>won</strong> the international competition <strong>\"The Factory 2023\"</strong>, outperforming over 20 teams. The app's success was driven by integrating <strong>native</strong> features of the <strong>Zebra</strong> terminal, such as a 3D scanner, within the Flutter framework.</p><p>A practical knowledge of native <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Android</strong> technologies is the foundation of my work with Flutter, enabling deep optimization and project configuration. I have hands-on experience working directly with native code, including <strong>updating</strong> existing native applications.</p><p>My previous career as an <strong>acoustics engineer</strong> has equipped me with valuable <em>precision in analyzing technical documentation</em> and the ability to <em>build professional client relationships</em>.</p><p>My experience is complemented by the completion of <strong>over</strong> 10 diverse, smaller applications.</p><p>Selected examples of my work are available for review in the \"<strong>Projects</strong>\" section.</p>",
