  "label.about_me.description": "<h3>For over 3.5 years, I've been passionately crafting mobile applications with Flutter, transforming complex business needs into simple and enjoyable-to-use solutions.</h3><p>I had the pleasure of co-creating an application for <strong>one of Poland's largest energy companies</strong>. It's currently actively used by over <strong>300,000 people</strong>, and its <strong>4.7</strong> rating in the Google Play and App Stores is a source of pride for me.</p><p>A particularly satisfying project was an application for a global logistics company, which <strong>won the grand prize</strong> in the international <strong>\"The Factory 2023\"</strong> competition, competing against over 20 teams. The key to success here was integrating <strong>native</strong> features of the <strong>Zebra</strong> terminal, such as a 3D scanner, with the capabilities of Flutter.</p><p>A good understanding of native <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Android</strong> technologies is fundamental to my effective work with Flutter. It allows me for deeper optimization and flexible project configuration, as well as working directly with native code, including when <strong>modernizing</strong> existing applications.</p><p>Before I fully dedicated myself to programming, as an <strong>acoustics engineer</strong>, I learned <em>precision in analyzing technical documentation</em> and the art of <em>building valuable relationships with clients</em> – skills I cherish to this day.</p><p>My portfolio is complemented by the completion of <strong>a dozen</strong> other, smaller applications of various kinds.</p><p>I invite you to explore selected projects in the \"<strong>Projects</strong>\" tab.</p>",
